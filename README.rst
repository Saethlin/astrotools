Disclaimer
----------
This project is pre-alpha, so I do not in any way suggest that any code you find here will be available at any time in the future, nor that it does anything useful. I do however submit that you may find it useful, and it might even be easy to plug some of astrotools directly in to a project.


Things I'm happy with:
---------------------------------
* align.py
* constants.py
* distributions.py
* misc.py

Things I'm working on:
-----------------------------------------
* viewfits.py
* MaximDL_dataproc.py

Things I don't expect to work particularly well:
--------------------------------------------------
* vectorize_starfield.py (for teaching purposes only)
* make_sample_data.py (for teaching purposes only)
