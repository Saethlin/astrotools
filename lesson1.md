When I started to learn Python in 2012 with the aim of doing Astronomy, I didn't find any resources to be imminently helpful. Everything was either too advanced or a computer science style tutorial that went way too slow. It is my hope that after this very fast-paced course you are able to do some Astronomy, with some idea of what's going on under the hood. Don't hesitate to use this as a reference, but do not rely on it. Consult web services like StackOverflow, as they will have up-to-date answers for your questions.

#So you want to learn Python?
Before we get to the real meat of the matter I want to take some time to make it clear why you should learn Python. I expect many readers will be reading this for simple reason, "I need to know programming to do research," "Python is the hot new language," or something along those lines. While those may be sufficient motivation, you should know _why_ you need to be proficient in programming to be good at Astronomy research and _why_ Python is the new language in Astronomy (and most science fields).

The answers to these questions are manyfold, but at the simplest level, programming is required out of necessity. The massive data sets of modern astronomy are unmanagable without at least proficient use of prebuilt tools like the rapidly-fading IRAF. Tools like IRAF will make data processing a tractable problem, but still leave the user with a huge amount of drudge work. It is the removal of such drudgery that make programming skills so valuable. Any problem that a human can solve, a computer can be programmed to solve (this is the basis of theoretical computer science). Therefore, I suggest to the reader that any data processing or data analysis program that must ask the user to intervene beyond some trivial initial settings is unfinished. This is actually the foundation of a common Python tutorial, Automate the Boring Stuff with Python.

So why Python? There are many other languages suitable for data processing, and in some cases an argument could be made that there are better choices. As of 2016 I am horrified that people still think that IDL is in general a better language for Astronomy than Python. There are two reasons Python is so widely used for data analysis: It is a language designed to be beautiful and easy-to-use, and it is very good at incorporating powerful libraries written C and Fortran.
Python sometimes gets criticism for being slower than other languages, which it is. Python values programmer time over CPU time, an increasingly good tradeoff as processing power increases. The reason for this difference is that Python is (mostly) interpreted, not compiled like C and Fortran. The reason for this is that Python is interpreted, while fast languages are compiled. An interpreter converts the text you write into machine code that the computer innately understands line-by-line. A compiler on the other hand converts an entire program at once, which lets it make all sorts of optimizations that can result in enormous speedups. This does however come at a cost; compiling takes time. Therefore, interpreted (or scripting) languages are preferred for data analysis because often we only run a program once, then tweak it, and run it again.

#Let's set up for some programming
If you have OSX or Ubuntu (probably most other Linux distros too), your computer should already have a version of Python installed. To check if you do, open a terminal (OSX) or command prompt (Windows). Search for and open your OS-appropriate terminal. You should get a prompt that you can type into. Enter the command `python` and press enter. If you don't get an error you at least have a Python interpreter installed. Otherwise you'll need one. I suggest Anaconda Python, a Python distribution produced by Continuum. Hit the Google and install it. You may be offered a choice between Python 2.7 and whatever the most recent version is (3.5 right now). I'll get into the difference later but for now I grudgingly admit that the best choice is probably 2.7, at least until the astro network is updated.

Now you need a text editor. We're not going to type individual commands into the interpreter, we want to write proper programs here. If you're using linux, gedit will suffice, otherwise I suggest Notepad++. If you don't have that or another text editor you have experience with, hit the Google and install it.

Once you have a Python interpreter and text editor installed you'll be able to learn some of the basics, so let's get started!

#Some basic programs
It's a programming tradition for the first program you write to have the computer print `Hello World`. Open up a text file and enter
`print('Hello World')`

Save the text file, making note of where you saved it, and open a terminal. Now you need to navigate to wherever you saved the text file and run it. You can use the command `cd` to change directory. To figure out what directory you're in on OSX and Linux use `pwd`, and on Windows `cd ,`. You can change directory to `..` to back up. Once you've navigated to the location of the text file enter the command `python your_text_file.py` to run it. Make sure to state the actual name of the text file you saved after `python `. The file extension (whatever comes after the .) doesn't really matter here, and in some sense it never really does. It's just a hint to your operating system when you tell it to run the file, how it should be run. Since you're passing the file to a Python interpreter here it doesn't matter. So run your file and you should your computer give you a slightly creepy response.

Now that you know some of the basics about running Python files, we can do a bit of math. To assign a value to a variable, use the `=` symbol. So for example, `x = 1` will assign the value `1` to some variable `x`. This lets you manipulate the value at a later time. All your standard mathematical operations apply, use `+` to add values, `-` to subtract, `*` for multiplication, `/` for division, and `**` for exponentiation. As a quick exercise, print the product of 1234 and 5.

When you wrote the Hello World program, the apostrophes you enclosed the text with defined what's called a string. Loosely, a string is a sequence of characters. It isn't really but that definition is good enough for now. You may find it interesting that the `*` and `+` operators can be used in other contexts. For example, you can print `'Hello World'` multiplied by an integer. You can also use the `+` operator on two strings to concatenate them. This hints at a fundamental detail of programming languages (but Python especially); these operators don't necessarily mean what they look like. Python inherits a lot of notation from mathematics to augment usability. Do you know what set builder notation is? Python supports that.

#Face-first into the Astronomy
##Opening FITS files
No messing around, it's time to do some things you'll actually have to do in the course of research: Let's open a FITS file. Python doesn't know how to do this on its own, but there is a package called AstroPy that has instructions for Python how how to read them. AstroPy doesn't come with Python by default, if we would say it is part of the standard library which is a set of packages that come with Python. We'll use some of  them later. If you installed Anaconda Python you already have AstroPy available. Otherwise you'll need to figure out how to get it. The terminal command `pip install astropy` should do the trick.

Once you have AstroPy ready, we need to introduce ask the Python interpreter to load it at the beginning of our little program. The import statement we want in this case is `from astropy.io import fits`. This is a statement you'll use often. We don't need all of AstroPy here, that would just make things messy so we specify that we only want the part of astropy's io (for input/output) module (packages are made of modules, one or many) that deals with reading and writing FITS files. I have provided you with a FITS file, make sure it is in the same location as the text file you're working with; this will just make things easier. Now we can use the command `some_variable = fits.open('the_fits_file_name')`. Pick your own variable name here, and do not think you're saving space or effort by keeping the name short. If you write a huge program variable names are your only hits at what the variables are. Get into the habit of using descriptive names now.

If you run that program you might notice that your prompt disappears for a brief moment. This is because reading from the hard drive takes a significant amount of time. In this case probably less than a second but if you need to process hundreds of files it adds up quickly. So with your fits file loaded, you can print the variable. You'll notice what you get is only sort of helpful. What AstroPy gives you here is an HDUList. FITS files can hold multiple images, so the most general format for loading one is a list of sorts. In this case, there is only one entry in the list. If you want to access that entry, you need to index the list. In Python this is done by placing square brackets `[]` after the value you want to index, and enclosing an integer in the square brackets. Python is C-based so the first entry is number `0`. Try printing the first entry in the HDUList.

You'll find you still don't get anything that looks too helpful. That is because you now have an HDU (Header Data Unit) which has a header and some data. To access an attribute of something in Python, use `some_thing.the_attribute`. You'll notice we already did this in the import statement. Your HDU has two useful attributes, data and header. Try printing both of them. If your terminal isn't 80 characters wide, the header will look like a mess. It should default to a width 80 if you didn't resize it. You can skim through the header, which normally contains a lot of useful information about the data. In this case it is only moderately enlightening. You may notice from the header information that this wan't taken at UF. I leave it as an exercise to any Floridians to guess where this was taken.

##Displaying images
You may have heard of DS9. If you haven't, it is an ancient program mostly used to open and look at FITS files. I'm now going to show you how to do all the display functionality you get from DS9 using Python. For this, we're going to need at least one other package, matplotlib (same procedure as AstroPy). This is a powerful plotting library modeled after Mathematica, and is how we're going to display the data (the image) stored in the sample FITS file. The import statement we want here is `from matplotlib import pyplot as plt`. This introduces some new syntax; when importing we don't have to stick with the name that the person who wrote the package used, we can substitute our own. In this case shortening the name is a good idea because when plotting you're going to be typing `plt` often and that import statement is pretty much standard.

So let's display the image. Open up the FITS file, and assign the first HDU's data to a variable. Then pass that variable to the `imshow` method of plt with `plt.imshow(the_image_data)`.
